# KiwiNet Emerging Innovators Project: Smart Gait Analysis Device

This repository contains the firmware and software used to interface with a wearable plantar load distribution device developed in the Biomimetics Laboratory of the Auckland Bioengineering Institute. 

The plantar load distribution device is comprised of a Arduino Nano 33 BLE as well as a Stretchsense capacitance reading board. The firmware of the Arduino makes use of BLE technology to relay information to a central BLE enabled PC.

A python GUI has been created to visualise the readings from the sensors, and can be used to monitor real time plantar loading data.
